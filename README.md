# Robot-cleaner
This is The Systems Enginnering Project to make an autonmous roomba that will pick small items up that would normally jam a standard Robot Vacumn.

Note: I have no idea what i'm doing so don't expect this to be the cleanest code or the most efficent way of performing a task, it just intends to work as a concept.
